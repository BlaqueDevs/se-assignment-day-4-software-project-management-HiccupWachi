## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Fleixibility;Agile is highly adaptable to changes,Waterfall is rigid,difficult to change once started.
Planning;Agile continuous planning throughout,waterfall is detailed upfront planning.
Approach;Agile is iterative and incrementalc,Waterfall is linear and sequential.
Testing;Agile - ongoing throughout development,Waterfall Done at the end,after development.
Deliverables; Agile is frequent with small increments,Waterfall delivered as a single final product.
Best suited for; Agile is complex and evolving projects,Waterfall is well-defined,stable projects.
Advantages and Disadvantages;
Agile;
1.Faster delivery of working software with iterative cycles.
2.Early identification and mitigation of risks.
3.Encourages collaboration and transparency.

5.Identifies potential risks related to scope changes early.
Work-Breakdown Structure;
-This is a hierarchial decomposition of a project into smaller,manageable tasks or work packages.
Visually represents the project scope and breaks it down into actionable components.
Key Features;
-Top down layout
-Breaks project into phases,deliverable or tasks.
-Each element is assigned a unique identifier for tracking.
